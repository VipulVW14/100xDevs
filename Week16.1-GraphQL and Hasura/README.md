//Part1
server: tsc -b-->generate dist folder, copy gql file in sit, node dist/index.js
client: npm i --save graphql-zeus, npm run zeus(in root folder), generate dist and run 

//Part2
hasura.io --> create a project in cloud, connect with a postgreSQL db(using neon.tech), 
compose docker file - docker-compose up --> localhost:8112, localhost:4446
run hasura GUI locally - npx hasura-cli console (in hasura folder)
run psql db locally - psql -h localhost -p 4446 -U user -d reef_dev

//Part3
solution in the docker compose file for the race condition between psql and hasura in part 2 


## How to create a GraphQL Server
1. create two folders "client" and "server" in your backend folder
2. server: create "src" folder, npm init -y, tsc --int, outDir: "./src", create you schema.gql and index.ts file, tsc -b, copy schema.gql to dist, node dist/index.js
3. client: npm init -y, tsc --init, outDir: "./src", npm i graphql-zeus, in package.json "scripts" instead of "test" write  "zeus": "npx graphql-zeus http://localhost:4000/graphql ./client",npm run zeus, tsc -b, node dist/index.js
 
4. "server" is the backend server running on 4000, we want our react app for eg to interact with is graphql server for that we have created client, autogenerated by zeus, create index.ts in the ./client and write the queries there using the autogenerated clients(using Chain(); gives you nice types) to interact with the backend graphQL server (rather than writing a axios query with complicated body and raw graphql query),and you those functions in the client/zeus folder in you react app on a onClick for eg.

hasura exposes a graphql server over a database
create a hasura project in and connect to a neon postgres db
create a server folder and create "hasura" folder and a docker-compose file, cd hasura--> npx hasura-cli console
